## Different Ways to Contribute

There are various ways that you can contribute to this project, ranging from creating new lesson to submitting bugs you've encountered.

### Creating New Lessons

Creating a new lesson is a pretty simple process.  

1. Select a new lesson from the suggestions
2. Fork the project from the Master branch
3. Make sure your dev environment is setup
4. Create the lesson
5. Create a Pull Request against the Master branch
6. Wait for Review
7. Update any requested changes
8. Merge

#### Lessons structure

Lessons are based on the types of sensors or output devices being used.  Any lesson that uses multiple of these sensors or devices should be placed in the `Advanced_Lessons` folder.  The only exception to this will be when combining a sensor or device and the LEDs.
