# RGB Flashing Lights

In this exercise, you'll learn how to get your CPE board to automatically change colors from Red, Green, and Blue every 0.5 seconds.  You will also learn about the following programming, Python, and other concepts:

* Tuples
* Color scales using RGB
* Infinite loops
* The "modulo" or "mod" (`%`) operator

## Required Setup

In this exercise you'll need the following:

* The CPE board, connected to your computer
* VsCode (or your fav editor) open with the `code.py` file open

# Tuples

In Python (and some other programming) languages, tuples are used as a way to store a sequence of objects.  What makes tuples unique from other sequences, is that once they are defined, they are immutable, or they cannot be changed.  To create a tuple in Python, you assign a variable a set of objects separated by a comma (`,`):

```python
my_first_tuple = 1, 2, 3
my_first_tuple
```

Typically, this assignment is also surrounded by parenthesis as well, BUT is not required.  However, I highly recommend that you do this for readability sake:

```python
my_first_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_first_tuple
```

## Color Scales Using RGB


## Infinite Loops

## The "Modulo" or "Mod" (`%`) Operator

## Putting It All Together

Go ahead and open up [`code.py`](code.py) associated with this exercise and copy and paste into the `code.py` on your CPE board.
