# Circuit Playground Express Learning

This repository is a collection of lessons that showcase some of the things you can do with the Circuit Playground Express (CPX) while teaching you basic concepts of programming and hardware interactions.  This assumes the usage of the Circuit Playground Express (CPX) board, specifcially the one given during PyCon 2019.

## Where To Get Started

If you're brand new to the CPX board, then read through the [Introduction](0_Introduction.md).  Otherwise, you should start with the first lesson

## Lesson Structure

The lessons are organized by hardware categories (such as LED's, Accellerometer, etc,).  Each of the lessons will contains a `lesson_name.md` file that goes into detail some of the hardware and programming concepts related.  There will also be a `code.py` that can be directly copied and pasted onto the CPX board for usage.  The lessons will be designed to build on the concepts taught within each other and therefore it is recommended to follow the lessons in order.

## How To Contribute

Feel free to contribute to this project as much as you want/can.  There are multiple areas that you can contribute to:

* Example creation
* Example testing and bug reporting
* Code review and cleanup

Don't feel like you need to be an expert at Python or the CPX board to be a contributor.  All are welcome.  For more details about how to contribute, check out our [contributing page](CONTRIBUTE.md)
